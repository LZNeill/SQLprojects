# SQLprojects
This project evaluates the net profit from each DVD rented from the fictional DVD rental company. 

It utilizes SQL and demonstrates the creation of a function to concatenate the film title and rating, creation of detailed and summary profit tables and data extraction to insert data into those tables and the calculation net profit.   This project also utilizes a trigger function to automatically update the summary table upon data insertion to the detailed table, and stored procedures to refresh the data in both tables.
